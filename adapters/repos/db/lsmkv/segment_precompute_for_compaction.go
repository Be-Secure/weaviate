// result this can be run without the need to obtain any locks. All files
// created will have a .tmp suffix so they don't interfere with existing
// segments that might have a similar name.
//
// This function is a partial copy of what happens in newSegment(). Any changes
// made here should likely be made in newSegment, and vice versa. This is
// absolutely not ideal, but in the short time I was able to consider this, I wasn't
// able to find a way to unify the two -- there are subtle differences.
